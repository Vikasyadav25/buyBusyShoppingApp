# Getting Started with Create React App
Developed an E-Commerce that enables individuals to browse available items, add of remove them from their shopping cart. and complete the purchasing process.
## Available Scripts
Project Acceptance criteria

1. The React app must be integrated with Firebase for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality of products in the cart.

2. The app must have the functionality to register new users and log in the existing users using Firebase Authentication.

3. The app must implement routing using react-router-dorm for different pages.

4. The app must implement the useContext() hook at least once for managing user authentication or products.

5. The app must implement proper state management and use React Hooks for handling user interactions and data updates.

6. The code quality of the React app must be of a high standard, with proper documentation of code and functionality.

7. There must be no cheating or copy-pasting of code from other sources, and all code must be original and developed specifically for this project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
